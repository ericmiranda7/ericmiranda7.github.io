1. **Learning** - I find writing further sticks things into my memory, a scarce resource for me
2. **Pressure** - This blog is public and readers irrespective, I find there's additional pressure for due diligence. That's a level of detail I wouldn't go into normally
3. **Markdown** - My aim is to be a ninja note-taker and I hope this blog, written exclusively in
markdown helps me get comfortable with something like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (Yes, Notion, but no vim keybindings, so no).
