## Why this blog ?
1. **Learning** - I find writing further sticks things into my memory, a scarce resource for me
2. **Pressure** - This blog is public and irrespective of any readers, I find myself pressured into
carrying out due diligence. That's a level of detail I wouldn't go into normally
3. **Markdown** - My aim is to be a ninja note-taker and I hope this blog written exclusively in
markdown helps me get comfortable with something like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
