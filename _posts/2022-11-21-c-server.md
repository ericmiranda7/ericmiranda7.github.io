I remember one of the first ever times I felt something "click" in the context of my comp sci studies - finding out what a client / server actually meant.
I had used high level frameworks like Django; my idea of servers being some complicated networked programs serving all types of files and text, magically responding to client web requests !
Then one day in my OS class, I saw a server implemented in plain ol' Java.

Click ! I was
amazed at the simplicity of this overloaded term, server.

# Let's go lower
Now, 3 years later, [inspired by this amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=low+level+learning+c+server), I felt the urge to understand client
/ server networking at a deeper, lower level. I'm talking C ! A language I haven't 
touched in quite a while, but always drawn to, for whatever reasons.

Lettuce begin
## The Server
We start off by creating a file, `server.c`
```bash
vim server.c
```
The usual scaffolding, with some comments on the process we'll follow
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  // 1. init some necessary data structures

  // 2. grab ourselves a socket

  // 3. bind

  // 4. listen

  // 5. accept

  // 6. process the request

  // 7. close, return

  return 0;
}
```

So first and foremost, what's a socket ?  
Drawing on wikipedia
> A (network) socket is a **software structure** within a networked node (essentially a computer)
that serves as a point for receiving data  
\- *don't quote me on this*

The text in bold, gives us an idea of what a socket really is. Some further googling will tell you
that a socket is just a file - inline with [the philosophy of unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file).

## 1. Data Structures
Let's skip (1) for now, and begin on (2)

## 2. Creating a socket
We here love `man`, not google.
> int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)  
\- *man 7 ip*

Let's take this line, one by one.  
**Return type**
- `int socket(...` the return type is an integer, essentially a file descriptor (we get this from
man) The file descriptor is the first available numbered file descriptor available for the processes

**Parameters**
- `int domain` the "communication domain". Suffice to know there's different types of sockets
depending on whether we're communicating between processes(IPC) or networks. In our case, network, the domain is AF_INET, once again, just an int constant that's understood by the kernel to mean a network socket
- `int type` the communication type, which could be [connection-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication) or [connectionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication). In our case, connection-oriented, the type is SOCK_STREAM, once again, just an int constant understood by the kernel
- `int protocol` the protocol type (remember TCP, UDP ?) In our case, there exists only one
protocol with a connection-oriented type within the network domain, and that's TCP. As per `man`, we can pass 0 here and the kernel would understand

Let's pop it in our code !

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// hey, we've gotta provide those lovely constants, don't we ?
// get it from man 2 socket !
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int main()
{
  // 1. init some necessary data structures

  // 2. grab ourselves a socket
  int sfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  // .
  // .
  // .
}
```
*When I finished writing the socket function call, I couldn't help but be amazed at the fact
that the arguments and return values were simply just `int`. How often might you see that in
Javascript ? Complicated, data-stuffed Objects would be returned and passed in left right
and center !*
